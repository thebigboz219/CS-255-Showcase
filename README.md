# CS-255-Showcase

  -  Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?  


  DriverPass was a theoretical driver learning company that wanted to have a 24/7 online learning resource that users could use to make driving appointments and access different learning material. This material would range from driver guides, safety manuals, and practice tests. The system would also keep track of any progress made through this material for user convenience.
  -  What did you do particularly well?  


  In my heart I want to say I did well in creating the different diagrams for this class. Looking back on the assignments however I still see things I could have done better or even added in general. This does fit well with the iterative nature of the design process as a whole. It would seem pointless if I couldn't find room for improvement in my own work. 
  -  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  


  Hands down I would revise my second project. Looking back on my first activity diagram I feel like I missed a very basic element of that use case by not incorporating a view appointments decision branch. Adding that branch or possibly extending the base decision branch to encorporate viewing appointments before branching off into the create and cancel options.
  -  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  


  When designing the system I had to make sure to incorporate the basics of appointment management on both the user's end and the owner's end. It was also stressed in the interview provided that packages varying in price be available for user's to purchase that gave them lesson hours and class hours to schedule with the system. The final package gave them access to the learning material that had practice tests they could take. The system would then need to mark progress made by the user in any material they study so user's would know where they left off. All of these things are critical for the system because the customer needs these functions to conduct their business effectivly. If we didn't include even one of their needs in the system, then they may find it useless and refuse to use it.
  -  How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?  


  I take a good bit of time reading over all reference and interview material when considering the design of a system. I want to try and give the client exactly what they want without bombarding them with extra little additives. In the future however I would like to try and get a second pair of eyes to help me look at the requirements. Having someone I can sit with and talk through the design with would help me in brainstorming the overall functionallity of the system.
